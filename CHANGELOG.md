# Changelog

## 2026-10-21

- Initial repository structure: `research/`, `guide/`, `templates/`.
- First research round: training frequency and volume evidence, splits and named
  programs, flexible-frequency programming, periodization and progression,
  exercise selection and session design, recovery, nutrition, and cardio.
- First edition of the training guide and 3/4/5/6-day templates.
- Guide chapters 00-06 written from the research notes; chapter 01 and 04 wording
  aligned with the rotation design in chapter 03 (one pass per calendar week in
  any 3-6-day week; at least 2 exposures per muscle, 3 for large muscles).
- Research note on mobile workout trackers added (Liftosaur and Hevy Pro are the
  two apps with an agent-writable program path).
- Chapter 07 on tracking and apps, a Liftosaur rendering of the rotation under
  `templates/liftosaur/`, and `templates/log-template.csv`.
- Added `tools/`: Hevy API pull, Hevy CSV import, history analysis that proposes
  starting loads per the progression tracks; `data/` for the normalized log.
- Imported the user's Hevy export (52 sessions, 2024-03 to 2026-10) to
  `data/history.csv`; `data/history-summary.md` holds the analysis and proposed
  starting loads. Analyzer gained alias exclusions and a pounds column.
- Added `data/track-state.md`: the live state of the six progression tracks in
  kilograms, seeded from the imported history, with the rotation pointer at L1.
